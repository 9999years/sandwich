title: Failure Report Formatter

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

The failure report formatter is similar to the print formatter, but it only prints failures. It's useful when you want less verbose output that only prints if something goes wrong. Like with the print formatter, it shows log messages, callstacks, and failure info in its messages.
